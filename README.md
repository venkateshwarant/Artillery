# Artillery_Tutorial


## General overview

In this project we will load test our product helloworld. We will determine some parameters such as 
* Minimum request latency
* Maximum request latency
* Median request latency
* 99th percentile value
* 95th percentile value

## Goals

With the above parameters, we will determine our products
* Analyze performance
  - How fast is it? / Is it fast enough?

* Soak testing
  - finding memory leaks and other resource leaks

* Analyze reliability
  - Does it degrade gracefully under stress?
  - Monitoring and alerting working as intended?

* Capacity testing
  - Can we handle projected load with accepted performance and with architecture/ hardware we already have

* Analyze scalability
  - How does the system scale if we add more servers / upgrade the hardware? Is it linear? Where are the bottlenecks?
